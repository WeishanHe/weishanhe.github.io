    I am a data enthusiast with two-year working experience in quantitative marketing research, and specialties in A/B Testing, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning, Data Management, and Data Visualization.
    <br> 
    <br>
    My skill set ranges from SQL, Python (Numpy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib),  R, Tableau, Looker, MongoDB, Spark, to Web Scraping. 
    In my recent practicum, I used Tableau to build two dashboards to help the pharmacy department at UCD Health to track its expanditure and administration process for 2,000+ medical items. 
    Please see *Projects* below for more interesting projects I conducted.
    <br>
    <br>
    The challenging process of converting large amount of raw data to insights to facilitate business decisions excites me a lot. As part of my leisure time, I keep developing my skillsets to better realize this goal.
