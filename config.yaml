    I am a machine learning practitioner with experience developing machine-learning-based products and directing experiments.
    <br> 
    <br>
    During the development and deployment of machine learning models, I used a variety of tools, including Python, SQL, Google Cloud Platform, Docker, Poetry, etc. 
    Currently, I am working at Andela as a Data Scientist to assist in the development of machine-learning features that will enable sustained growth in a dynamic marketplace.
    Please see *Projects* below for more interesting projects I conducted.
    <br>
    <br>
    The challenging process of transforming large amounts of raw data into intelligent tools makes me very excited. As part of my leisure time, I continue to develop my skill sets in order to achieve this goal.
