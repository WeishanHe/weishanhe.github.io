Like many others, my introduction to experimentation was through Frequentist A/B testing. As I familiarized myself with concepts like p-values and statistical power, it took some time for me to streamline the bayesian framework of conducting experiments. In this article, I aim to guide you through the essential process of Bayesian A/B testing using an example along with some practical codes.</description></item></channel></rss>
