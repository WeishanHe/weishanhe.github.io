Like many others, my introduction to experimentation was through Frequentist A/B testing. As I familiarized myself with concepts like p-values and statistical power, it took some time for me to streamline the bayesian framework of conducting experiments. In this article, I aim to guide you through the essential process of Bayesian A/B testing using an example along with some practical codes.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://weishanhe.github.io/resume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://weishanhe.github.io/resume/</guid><description>Weishan He PROFILE A data scientist with expertise in building Machine-Learning-based products to facilitate business growth, A/B Testing, Data Management, and Data Visualization
